//Week 7 Recipe: Fibonacci Numbers

//Ingredients:
//A Coding Student
//Knowledge of Fibonacci Equation F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)
//Basic Knowledge of Fibonacci Sequence to check for errors in code (e.g. 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21…)
//Knowledge of Swift Functions
//Define a Function func calcFibonacciTo1000
//Call the Function usually at the bottom of your code but don’t forget this
//Define a Variable for Fibonacci Sequence and initialize an Array (var fibonaccSequenceArray)
//Use a Control Statement or Loop to repeat through the function
//Append numbers to your Array using the .append method or +=
//Use a Break statement or Else statement when the loop reaches to 1000
//Use Print statement to display Array

//Directions:
//To calculate Fibonacci numbers up to 1000 in Swift, start by defining a function called calcFibonacciTo1000. Within this function, initialize an array to store the Fibonacci sequence, beginning with the first two numbers, 0 and 1. Use a while loop to repeatedly calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two numbers in the array. After each calculation, append the new Fibonacci number to the array. The loop should continue until the next Fibonacci number exceeds 1000, at which point the loop will terminate using a break statement. Finally, use a print statement to display the Fibonacci sequence stored in the array.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//STEP 1) Write a function that calculates and displays all the Fibonacci numbers from 0 to 1000







//STEP 2) Record a Panopto video of you demoing your working code
