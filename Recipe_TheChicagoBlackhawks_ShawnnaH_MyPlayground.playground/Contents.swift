//Pseudocode Outline Exercise
//Assignment: Recipe The Chicago Blackhawks
//Objective: For The Chicago Blackhawks Lab provide a recipe with Ingredients and Directions.


//Ingredients:
//Chicago Blackhawks Roster Information
//Dictionary of Team Members
//Arrays for Age, Country, Height, Birthday Month, etc
//Create new variables for sorted data or averages
//A Coding Student


//Directions:
//Create a dictionary with key PlayerNumber and use Tuples for the rest of the data and make sure you put the right types for the data.

//Don't create a bunch of arrays that are unnessary when you can create a dictionary with Tuples.
//But if you do create multiple Arrays
    //playerNumber to store jersey numbers
    //playerNames to store player names
    //playerAges to store birthdates or ages
    //playerCoutries to store the countries of the players
    //playerHeights to store Height in inches
    //playerBirthdayMonth to store birthday month

//Using control flow statements do the following;

//Create a list of players sorted by age
    //Sort the players using playerAges
    //Combine data and print out

//Create a list of players sorted by country
    //Sort the players using playerCountries
    //Combine data and print out

//Calculate the average age of the players
    //Get the sum of all playerAges in the array
    //Get the total number of players
    //Divide the sum by count of players to get average age
    //Print to the consol

//Calculate the average height of the players
    //Convert data if needed
    //Get the sum of all playerHeights in inches from playerHeight array
    //Divide sum by count of players
    //Convert inches to feet and inches
    //Print average height to the Consol

//Determine the month in which most of the players birthday falls
    //Used a Dictionary with key Month and Value to Count how many players have birthdays in that month
    //Find the max count value
    //Figure out how to print correctly
